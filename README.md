# Spotify-API-Discover-Weekly-App

In this project, we used a dataset containing a certain user's liked songs and disliked songs from playlists on their Spotify account (User songs 3.csv). From there, we analyzed key song features of this dataset in order to train our different machine learning models to recognize songs this user would like, and dislike. After we trained those models, we found the model that yielded the highest accuracy (Support Vectore Machine at 92%) and then used it on another dataset of newly-released music (New Music Friday.csv) in order to recommend the user a subset of those new songs to listen to.
